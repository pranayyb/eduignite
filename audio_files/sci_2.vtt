WEBVTT

00:00.928 --> 00:06.893
We will start with the second chapter on science class 6 that talks about the components of food.

00:07.334 --> 00:13.700
Now definitely since we are talking about food it would be one of the mouth watering classes that you would come across.

00:13.840 --> 00:23.528
Now when we talk about the components of food we first talk about the components that are derived either from plants or from animals.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.110
So we have a list of

00:26.360 --> 00:31.164
food products which are derived from plants and which are derived from animals.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.988
So let's say meat, fish, all milk products.

00:35.388 --> 00:37.690
So you have cheese, paneer, butter.

00:37.730 --> 00:46.838
So all those would be food products that are derived from animals and in the first diagram we have all the pulses, nuts.

00:47.219 --> 00:51.883
So all those would be example of food products that are derived from plants.

00:52.282 --> 01:03.966
So, first of all we understand that the food products can be classified into two heights, one that is derived from the plants and the other that is derived from the animals.

01:04.447 --> 01:11.149
Now, when we talk about the composition, what does food product actually includes?

01:11.409 --> 01:13.890
So, food includes various components.

01:14.650 --> 01:18.712
We cannot say I can eat potatoes for the whole day.

01:19.447 --> 01:25.691
If I eat potatoes for the whole day, the only source of energy that I would be getting is carbohydrates.

01:26.492 --> 01:32.556
Similarly, if I am eating only green vegetables, I would be getting minerals and vitamins.

01:33.036 --> 01:42.862
But to have a kind of healthy body and a balanced diet, we need to have a balance of all the essential things that we require.

01:43.222 --> 01:48.466
So our body requires for a good functioning carbohydrates and fats.

01:49.188 --> 01:53.990
Carbohydrates and fats together are known as energy giving food.

01:54.370 --> 01:58.412
So both carbohydrates and fats provide energy.

01:59.372 --> 02:03.273
Now good examples of fat would be ghee, oil.

02:03.574 --> 02:05.594
So all those would go under fats.

02:06.035 --> 02:13.337
When we talk about carbohydrates, we will talk or we will understand about the food that provides starch.

02:13.637 --> 02:14.878
So for example, rice,

02:15.550 --> 02:16.711
you have potatoes.

02:17.071 --> 02:20.633
So all those would be rich in carbohydrate.

02:21.493 --> 02:25.015
Coming on to the next category you have proteins.

02:25.615 --> 02:33.019
Proteins are those which are considered as body building or those are the building blocks of the body.

02:33.439 --> 02:35.561
So they help in the growth of the body.

02:36.201 --> 02:43.745
As a result some of the common things that include protein are pulses

02:44.740 --> 02:49.823
So, from the vegetarian diet or from the plant sources we can say those are pulses.

02:50.283 --> 02:53.465
So, we are being is indeed a very rich source of protein.

02:54.886 --> 03:00.789
From the animal sources you have meat, fish.

03:01.009 --> 03:03.611
So, all those would be sources of protein.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.232
Then you again have egg.

03:06.552 --> 03:08.333
Coming on to the next category.

03:08.534 --> 03:12.416
The next category is vitamins on minerals.

03:13.076 --> 03:14.417
Vitamins are minerals.

03:15.363 --> 03:19.987
are basically considered as the protective food.

03:20.447 --> 03:29.534
So they help us build immune system and once you have a strong immune system, you have the resistance to fight the various diseases.

03:30.094 --> 03:33.497
So vitamins and minerals are obtained from various plants.

03:33.917 --> 03:39.821
So all the fruits, all the green leafy vegetables are with sources of vitamins and minerals.

03:40.802 --> 03:44.725
And finally, you have fiber that is essential for the diet.

03:45.257 --> 03:53.485
So fiber basically comes as rough age and most of it is removed as undigested part.

03:54.166 --> 04:05.577
However this is important for the normal functioning of the body and therefore fiber which is also classified in higher standards as you go you would come across the word rough age

04:06.067 --> 04:11.049
And that is very important source or important constituent of your daily diet.

04:11.510 --> 04:16.152
Now we have talked about what all incorporates or includes our diet.

04:16.732 --> 04:27.857
Now we would come across the various tests to understand whether a component has decent amount of carbohydrate, decent amount of fats or not.

04:29.321 --> 04:31.962
Understanding that is again very important.

04:32.362 --> 04:36.143
We have different tests that we would apply to help understand bees.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.603
But a kind of general idea about this.

04:40.103 --> 04:45.305
Again, we would repeat the basic elements, carbohydrates and fats provide us energy.

04:45.905 --> 04:50.386
Definitely fats provide more energy as compared to carbohydrates.

04:50.866 --> 04:56.327
Proteins are the building blocks or they provide or help in the growth of the body.

04:56.979 --> 05:02.506
Vitamins and minerals are protective foods, they protect us from the various diseases.

05:03.367 --> 05:11.758
Again under vitamins you have different vitamins, you have A, D, E, K. All these are fat soluble with vitamins

05:12.298 --> 05:16.519
Then you have vitamin B and C which are water soluble.

05:16.940 --> 05:20.921
So, we classify vitamins as water soluble and fat soluble.

05:21.341 --> 05:26.463
Vitamin B and C are water soluble and dissolve in water very quickly.

05:26.843 --> 05:38.247
So, all the green leafy vegetables you have lemon juice, orange juice, all those citrus fruits which are rich in vitamin C would dissolve in water or are soluble in water.

05:38.667 --> 05:42.489
However, vitamin A, D, E, K are fat soluble.

05:42.529 --> 05:44.130
So, that is again very, very important.

05:44.650 --> 05:54.916
Fibers come from the various pulses, green leafy vegetables, grains, all these add to the bulk or the volume of the food that we intake.

05:55.476 --> 05:58.538
Now, let us start with the various test.

05:58.952 --> 06:04.594
So, the first test we would do is for understanding the amount of fat.

06:05.055 --> 06:07.095
So, we have two blotting papers here.

06:07.616 --> 06:12.478
This is a plain blotting paper as you can see and does not have any strain.

06:12.938 --> 06:17.440
Now, what I did was I put down few drops of oil on this

06:18.020 --> 06:18.820
piece of paper.

06:19.181 --> 06:29.686
So, if you can see this sheet turns out to be translucent and there can be difference in the two colors that could be seen and that is primarily due to the presence of the oil.

06:29.966 --> 06:34.788
So, when you put a drop of oil on a blotting paper you can try it at home by yourself.

06:35.189 --> 06:44.033
When you put a drop of oil on a blotting paper it would leave a scar or a kind of blot and the paper would turn to be translucent.

06:45.005 --> 06:50.407
So, to make the simple here, we explain the three terms opaque, transparent and translucent.

06:50.847 --> 06:53.468
So, this sheet of paper is opaque.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.048
I cannot see through it.

06:55.128 --> 06:57.909
You cannot see my face when this sheet is in between.

06:58.449 --> 07:04.891
However, let me bring this jar in between and you can see the reflection here out.

07:05.231 --> 07:08.672
And therefore, you this is a kind of transparent.

07:09.052 --> 07:11.813
Since there are two layers, it is not exactly that transparent.

07:12.412 --> 07:13.973
The next is translucent.

07:14.053 --> 07:19.334
When you look through a translucent thing, it appears to be a kind of blurred image.

07:19.394 --> 07:30.838
So what you can see is the hand you can see here is a kind of blurred image of a hand rather than a clean image of a hand which you can see through a transparent object like I have a

07:31.393 --> 07:37.037
glass here and from here you can see the hand is very clear and that is what is transparent.

07:37.438 --> 07:44.323
So we understood opaque transparent and translucent within this lecture and we talked about the test of fat.

07:44.843 --> 07:48.286
Now coming on to the test of starch, I have a potato here.

07:48.306 --> 07:52.850
I will just take a section out of it and I have this section.

07:52.990 --> 07:56.933
What I will do is I will pour a drop of iodine.

07:57.994 --> 07:59.475
So I have iodine here.

08:00.238 --> 08:02.780
and I will pour a drop of iodine on this.

08:04.742 --> 08:21.595
Now, when I pour a drop of iodine on the crushed potato, it initially the iodine was red and orange in color, but what happened here was a kind of dark violet scar is seen and that shows this potato has significant amount of starch.

08:22.416 --> 08:29.442
So, when you take a test of starch, you put iodine on potato or rice or whatever experiment you want to do.

08:30.023 --> 08:33.265
And then you can see a kind of blue black color that is sea.

08:34.106 --> 08:37.728
And therefore, we can say that this potato has starch.

08:38.289 --> 08:40.930
Coming on to the next test, that is protein.

08:41.311 --> 08:43.992
Now for the taste of protein, I have two things here.

08:44.513 --> 08:47.835
One is the dal solution that's normal chanadal.

08:48.175 --> 08:49.496
And then you have a milk.

08:49.856 --> 08:58.382
We will put the drops of copper sulfate and caustic soda or sodium hydroxide.

08:58.772 --> 09:07.016
that's NaOH, so you have NaOH and C2SO4 copper sulphate that we would be mixing in this.

09:07.476 --> 09:16.520
So what I'll do is I'll simply mix this solution that I have here in both of this and let's turn out to see what the results are there.

09:17.260 --> 09:24.243
So this and the milk just a second.

09:24.884 --> 09:28.005
So we have this solution with the milk as well.

09:28.559 --> 09:30.640
And now what I do is I'll steer it.

09:32.561 --> 09:50.392
So when I steer it you have a color change that is seen and then you can see this milk turns out to be kind of bluish purple color that is seen and then you have this dal solution that I would try to steer here and you would have a color change that is seen.

09:50.792 --> 09:52.273
So you would have a blue

09:52.927 --> 09:54.448
purple color that is seen.

09:54.928 --> 10:05.616
Now the component of the color that is seen in this is different from this and that shows both of them have components of protein but the amount of protein in these two vary.

10:05.956 --> 10:14.382
The one that comes out with a dark purple color would have a higher component of protein as compared to one that comes out with a light purple color.

10:14.723 --> 10:16.964
So that is what is the test of protein.

10:17.244 --> 10:20.707
So what we have done for now is the test of starch

10:21.207 --> 10:25.349
which we did using the potato and putting out iodine on it.

10:25.749 --> 10:30.550
Then we had the test of starch which we saw with the oil and the plotting paper.

10:30.891 --> 10:42.815
And finally, the test for protein where we put out a solution of copper sulfate and NaOH that is caustic soda into the two protein samples that we have taken.

10:43.248 --> 10:45.850
Now again I have a piece of wallet here.

10:46.310 --> 10:52.634
What I do is I take a small section of this and I simply press it with my finger.

10:53.334 --> 10:56.816
Now this is something that you can do at your home and check out.

10:57.296 --> 11:12.065
Keep pressing it for a while and once you remove it, if you look onto the finger carefully you would have kind of oil drops that I see and that shows the presence of oil or fat in the wallet.

11:12.523 --> 11:17.767
So, that is what is the experiment to understand the various components in the food.

11:18.307 --> 11:24.592
Now, definitely when we are using the various components, there is a requirement for the balanced diet.

11:25.133 --> 11:35.060
If we do not meet out with that balanced diet, a body suffers from various deficiencies and these deficiencies lead to different kind of diseases.

11:35.560 --> 11:41.445
So, deficiency of each and every component in the body leads to different kind of diseases.

11:42.327 --> 11:46.946
So if there is deficiency of vitamin A, you would have poor vision.

11:47.747 --> 11:57.153
If there is deficiency of vitamin B, now vitamin B as you move into the higher standards, it is further classified as B1, B2, B12 and so on and so forth.

11:57.493 --> 12:01.296
So each and every vitamin would have a kind of different deficiency disorder.

12:01.676 --> 12:03.217
Berryberry is a common disease.

12:03.577 --> 12:12.383
Then basically what happens is the muscles get weaker when you have deficiency of vitamin B. Vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy.

12:12.883 --> 12:15.164
Now this disease was common in the sailors.

12:15.544 --> 12:30.712
What used to happen is the sailors or the navigators used to travel a lot and in the ocean they could not find food that are rich in vitamin C and they used to suffer from the deficiency of vitamin C which was predominantly the bleeding gums.

12:31.312 --> 12:36.675
Now what their sailors later on used to do was they used to carry along with them

12:37.902 --> 12:54.271
small amount of lemons and oranges so that they can meet out the deficiency of vitamin C. The next is vitamin D. Vitamin D can be obtained through natural exposure from the sunlight and a deficiency of vitamin D leads to a disease which is known as rickets.

12:54.911 --> 12:57.673
Then again from the minerals you have iron,

12:58.260 --> 13:00.701
iodine, calcium, those are predominant.

13:01.121 --> 13:03.663
Calcium helps in the formation of strong bones.

13:04.063 --> 13:09.705
Deficiency of calcium would lead to breaking of the bones or decay of the bones.

13:10.086 --> 13:11.186
Then you have iodine.

13:11.406 --> 13:14.448
Deficiency of iodine leads to a disease known as guiter.

13:14.888 --> 13:20.130
Similarly, iron deficiency leads to anemia or lack of hemoglobin in the blood.

13:20.470 --> 13:24.892
Now blood comprises of three cells, RBCWBC and platelets.

13:26.385 --> 13:30.488
red blood corpses then you have white blood and finally you have platelets.

13:30.869 --> 13:37.154
So red blood says have hemoglobin and efficiency of the hemoglobin leads to the disease which is anemia.

13:37.614 --> 13:40.457
So that's the kind of basic outline that we understand.

13:41.337 --> 13:44.900
Now we come on to a very important aspect of food.

13:45.721 --> 13:53.047
All of us consume food for our survival but have you ever thought about cleaning and handling of the food

13:53.685 --> 13:58.407
The food that we eat is not available in nature as it is.

13:58.907 --> 14:06.710
It undergoes series of handling processes and finally we have a food item that we can enjoy and eat.

14:07.390 --> 14:12.152
Now, we would understand what are those series of steps that go through.

14:12.512 --> 14:17.974
Before that, there is a common myth which says costlier foods

14:18.413 --> 14:24.397
are much more nutritious, that's a kind of proper myth and that actually does not happen.

14:25.138 --> 14:29.080
Each and every food is important for a balanced diet as we said.

14:29.721 --> 14:35.484
Again, washing of the food, cleaning of the food, those are some of the basic things that are required.

14:35.745 --> 14:41.969
So what we do is, if supposedly if you want to consume an apple, you would wash an apple and then eat an apple.

14:42.349 --> 14:46.912
So that's the way to remove the outer germs that exist on the food.

14:48.181 --> 14:56.168
Again when we talk about apple you have the outer layer most of the nutrients are present just underneath that outer layer.

14:56.508 --> 15:07.057
So whenever you are peeling a kind of fruit it's very important you have a very thin layer that is being peeled out as a result maximum nutrients are preserved.

15:07.597 --> 15:10.900
Now here we have a table this would be available on the website.

15:11.304 --> 15:17.070
So you would have the various vitamins and the diseases and what does the deficiency lead to?

15:17.431 --> 15:19.393
Most of that we have already discussed.

15:19.773 --> 15:24.959
Now we would come on to one of the most important aspects is cleaning of the food.

15:25.479 --> 15:30.264
There are four ways, I would say five primary ways in which we can clean the food.

15:30.765 --> 15:32.507
The first is threshing.

15:33.047 --> 15:40.849
Now, what happens is if you go on to the countryside area villages, you would see you have stalks of greens that are there.

15:41.229 --> 15:49.531
So, these stalks are being trashed on the ground and finally, you have the greens that are separated from the long stacks.

15:49.971 --> 15:52.432
And that is what is the process of threshing.

15:52.932 --> 15:57.733
The next comes is, sorry, the next that comes is winoing.

15:58.375 --> 16:03.558
Undervenuing what happens is you try to separate out based on the weight.

16:03.859 --> 16:06.480
So I have some peanuts here that you can see.

16:07.020 --> 16:11.543
Now these peanuts some of them does not have a cover and others have a cover.

16:11.864 --> 16:16.466
So what I do is I simply crush those out and what you can see is if I

16:17.690 --> 16:21.833
put a blow of air the lighter covers with flow away.

16:22.174 --> 16:32.862
So, what people used to do or people still do in villages you can see you have a kind of dish where you keep all the greens and you just blow air.

16:33.763 --> 16:40.048
So, you can see most of the lighter things flew away and you have the solid part that remains.

16:40.389 --> 16:41.950
So, this separation

16:42.787 --> 16:47.809
which is done by the process of winoing separates things based on the density.

16:48.229 --> 16:56.912
So the lighter the things those flow away and the heavier remains in the or heavier comes down and the lighter flows away.

16:57.253 --> 16:58.793
So that's what is winoing.

16:59.173 --> 17:00.294
The next is sewing.

17:00.634 --> 17:04.715
Now sewing is done through what we say a kind of net.

17:05.196 --> 17:07.797
What happens is I have two things here.

17:07.817 --> 17:11.518
I have a tray that I put here and I just put this here.

17:12.240 --> 17:17.901
I put some peanuts here and then I put some mustard seeds which are very small.

17:18.241 --> 17:25.982
So these small mustard seeds when I put here they came down in the plate and that's what we try to explain.

17:26.383 --> 17:29.903
So what happens is we separate things based on the size.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.244
So size and the number.

17:32.704 --> 17:38.945
What happens under seedling is we separate out two things based on the size and the number.

17:39.385 --> 17:40.505
Then is hand picking.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.453
Hand picking is very simple.

17:42.874 --> 17:44.975
I have a kind of set of things here.

17:45.295 --> 17:46.496
So I have mustard seeds.

17:46.696 --> 17:47.577
I can separate those.

17:47.937 --> 17:48.758
I have peanuts.

17:48.938 --> 17:50.579
I have almonds and I have walnuts.

17:50.599 --> 17:53.282
So I can separate all of these by hand picking.

17:53.562 --> 17:59.566
So hand picking can be done based on size, based on color, based on the shape.

17:59.867 --> 18:03.429
So there can be various ways under which you can do hand picking.

18:03.810 --> 18:06.712
So these are the primary four things that we understand.

18:07.536 --> 18:25.569
The next set that we would be talking about talks about four important aspects that separation, then you have sedimentation, filtration and finally decantation.

18:28.811 --> 18:31.293
Now let's talk about separation.

18:31.733 --> 18:32.994
I have a flask here.

18:33.674 --> 18:35.916
Just see this carefully.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.632
So you have 3 layers out here.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.493
The top most is the mustard oil.

18:41.873 --> 18:46.555
Below the mustard oil we have water and in the lower most layer we have sand.

18:47.115 --> 18:52.777
Now what we have done is we have done a separation between oil and water.

18:53.227 --> 19:04.231
So these two liquids occur in different levels and you can see those very clearly as separated out and therefore we tell that this is the process of separation.

19:04.751 --> 19:13.075
What happens under sedimentation is the stones or the bigger size particles settle down and that is what is sedimentation.

19:13.515 --> 19:18.757
Now same thing when we want to explain decantation what I do is I take another

19:19.485 --> 19:22.248
thing and I drop the upper layer here.

19:22.528 --> 19:36.101
So, what would happen is the water would be separated from the oil or I put this water and oil mixture in a big flask or a kind of funnel and just pour it.

19:36.141 --> 19:43.888
So, what would happen is the lighter things and the heavier things would separate out and when you are doing that in two different containers

19:44.268 --> 19:47.731
So, you have oil in one container, you have water in another container.

19:47.991 --> 19:54.275
So, what would happen is that process would be known as decantation and finally, is filtration.

19:54.516 --> 19:57.998
So, filtration is just removing the two liquids.

19:58.298 --> 20:04.443
So, basically if you are preparing tea, you are removing the tea leaves and the tea that you can see.

20:04.903 --> 20:06.243
in the cup below.

20:06.483 --> 20:08.304
So, that is the process of filtration.

20:08.364 --> 20:10.544
Filtration can be also done with filter paper.

20:10.884 --> 20:22.687
However, all of this what we have discussed now the separation of substance is a separate chapter 5 that we would be continuing again and we would be discussing the same things in further detail in that lecture.

20:23.147 --> 20:31.069
So, here we are just bringing this into the concept to help understand the idea of cleaning of the food.

20:31.109 --> 20:32.749
So, here our basic focus is

20:33.552 --> 20:35.033
how do we clean the foods?

20:35.313 --> 20:43.297
So, sedimentation as we said you mix sediment with water and this sediment settles out and you have the water on the upper area.

20:43.577 --> 20:46.178
Similarly, you have the decantation process that occurs.

20:46.459 --> 21:00.706
So, as we said food can be cleaned by various processes first is been knowing where you have the impurity that is separated based on the weight as we did in the case of peanut, we removed out the cover of the peanut.

21:00.986 --> 21:03.187
Then you have hand picking, we can pick by hand.

21:03.570 --> 21:12.161
Threshing where the stalks are separated from the grains, sieving where you have the impurity that are separated based on the size and the number.

21:12.561 --> 21:16.086
So, what we did through using this net was the example of sieving.

21:16.694 --> 21:20.156
And finally, sedimentation, decandation, filtration and separation.

21:20.477 --> 21:25.500
So, all this we have tried to introduce only with respect to cleaning of the food here.

21:25.860 --> 21:33.065
We would be covering all this in detail when we would be talking about the separation of substances in the further chapters.

21:33.485 --> 21:36.547
So, stay tuned for more updates and more lectures in science.

21:37.248 --> 21:41.791
We would definitely be working around classics and we would move on to higher lectures.

21:42.572 --> 21:53.565
As we complete class 6 do subscribe to the channel if you have any suggestions or any comments leave those in the comment box below will be happy to resolve it have a very good day ahead.
