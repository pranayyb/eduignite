It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional \\nframework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy.  \\nThis foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage, which enhances creativity and inculcates values among children that are nurtured throughout their lives. \\nThe Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational and the \\nMiddle Stages, spanning three years from Class 3 to Class 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way, discovery, and activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and more formal classroom settings. This\\n introduction aims not to overwhelm \\nbut \\nto establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic \\nlearning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach, based on the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 as a follow up of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social science. This comprehensive approach ensures that children are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transit to the Middle Stage. \\nThe textbook, Bansuri – I for Class 3 is for Arts — the subject which \\nhas been formally introduced as one of the curricular areas for the first time with adequate time allocation as per NCF-SE 2023. Designed on the recommendations of the NEP 2020 and the NCF for School Education 2023, it not only leads towards the creative pursuance of children, but also opens up the fifth panchkosha\\n — anandmaya \\nkosha.

All visuals and illustrations represent and ensure participation of all children including children with special needs. There are assessment points embedded in the activities. Since all art forms  \\nare deeply rooted in Bharat’s rich cultural traditions and heritage,  \\nthe textbook Bansuri ensures children an experiential journey to different parts of the country through all art forms. \\nWhile this textbook is valuable, children will be encouraged to \\nexplore additional resources on the subject. Parents and teachers need to support their endeavours by facilitating their research in school libraries and ICT-based resources through QR Code. An effective learning environment motivates students and keeps them engaged, fostering curiosity which is vital for learning.\\nI recommend this textbook with confidence to all students and \\nteachers at the Preparatory Stage.

The book has been developed on the basis of the recent \\npolicy documents, National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. These documents aim to ensure that all children achieve the Curricular Goals (CGs) and the competencies appropriate to this age and stage.  \\nA syllabus has been developed based on the CGs, competencies as well as the desired learning outcomes. The NCF-SE has recommended Arts as one of the compulsory subjects up to Grade 10, and also recommends that the schools give one hundred hours per academic session to Arts, which has the four following components or areas, namely, Music, Theatre, Dance and Visual Arts. Thus the textbook Bansuri has been divided into four units comprising 5 chapters in each unit. There are many activities in every chapter which children of this class can easily do with your intervention. You have to play a very important role in the process of discovery and creativity which every child is going to experience throughout the year.\\nDo You Know?\\nThis is perhaps the first time that a textbook  of Arts for the Preparatory Stage has been developed for students that gives them space to draw, note down, read and comprehend other activities, individually as well as in groups. Though children start singing, dancing, mimicking, and scribbling from the toddler stage, and even before these become a formal part of the schooling process, this will be their first experience of having a meaningful Arts class consisting of Music, Theatre, Dance and Visual Arts under your able guidance — working together in groups, communicating their ideas and feelings, including the artistic journey \\nEducation Policy must help  \\nre-establish teachers, at all \\nlevels, as the most respected and essential members of our society, because they truly shape our next generation of citizens.

Children may be made aware of the colour coding used in the book and the audio book will be available on the NCERT website for visually impaired children\\n —\\nBlUe for Music \\nYellow\\n for Visual Arts \\nPUrPle for Theatre \\nPink\\n for Dance \\n The four art \\nforms each have a unit dedicated to them. Even though \\nthey are unique in their own stead, they have very interesting similarities, just like all the children. Each unit begins with an introduction about the art form which the learner will experience. There are plenty of hints for you to organise activities and look for resources, especially resources embedded in the QR Code of each chapter. In case you do not have access to the internet, you can either take the children to performances or invite local artists, folk musicians, dancers, and other performers to the school for interaction. Many of the parents and other community members  who are skilled in an art form may agree to perform for the children. Interactive sessions with the artists and performers may be organised frequently in the school, where children may be encouraged to ask questions. This will be inspiring\\n for children. You will need to\\n \\ntake the children out of the classroom, in and out of the school, to look around, feel the nature, and observe day-to-day activities of people around \\n0 Prelims.indd   6 25-06-2024   15:37:07\\n'),\n",

Organising field trips to watch plays, dance performances, music \\nconcerts and art exhibitions would help in motivating children. There are a number of activities that have been suggested; you can pick and choose from these activities, create more such activities and also contextualise them in terms of content, locally available materials, and other resources. It is important to keep in mind that most activities in this book can be carried out without any specialised resources, or can be adapted to be conducted with only simple and locally-available resources.\\nThe timetable is to be designed in a way that children get the \\nopportunity to have specified periods for all the four art forms allocated every week. Wherever possible, a block period or two combined periods can be kept for children to do the activities, since all the activities are quite engaging and enjoyable. The NEP 2020 gives equal weightage to all subjects including arts. Thus, there is a humble request to the parents not to discourage their children for doing art activities at home. The teachers and schools have to ensure that the periods alloted for arts are not used for other subjects.\\nDuring the first few minutes of every art class, children can just \\nsit with their eyes closed and remember what they have done in the previous class. \\nThe last 10 minutes may be kept for discussion as ‘Circle Time’. As \\nsuggested in the Theatre section, all children, along with the teacher, sit together and talk freely. But this time, it is informal only for the child. The teachers are required to take notes for themselves that can be applied in their next lesson plans.\\nThis spirit of a holistic learning environment for the child to \\nunderstand the concepts is fully reflected in the textbook and pedagogy. The teacher should support and help them to work in groups or \\n0 Prelims.indd   7 25-06-2024   11:39:27\\n'),\n",

This is true \\nfor all the four art forms in this book. Children may be encouraged to further look around to explore and observe, continue to do art work, and practice at home as well as what they do in the classroom.\\nThe assessment tools have also been suggested to mark the progress \\nof the level of competency and skill development in a child. In Arts, there is no pass or fail; nothing is good or bad at this stage. There is always scope for improvement and children should be encouraged to complete the activities with an understanding of the concepts, rather than being discouraged. Education is a long journey for them and just as every child is different, so are their skills and expressions, and this diversity is the beauty of their childhood. They or their performances should not be compared with anyone in the classroom; instead, their individual progression needs to be assessed. They have to compete with themselves for improvement. \\nWhat Do You Need for an Arts Class?\\nFor all art activities, you need a well-lit space which may be in or out of the classroom, where children can move around freely. You will need very simple material for props for theatre: art material — tools and basic stationery; space for safely storing material as well as students’ artwork in an organised manner; display boards for showcasing  \\nand sharing works of children; computer, projector, and speaker for  \\nplaying audio-video resources; simple musical instruments; etc. Make sure that the material and resources are well utilised and they are locally available. \\nWe hope that every teacher and parent will find this book to be \\nuseful, interesting and resourceful, making every art class exciting and something to look forward to.

This includes children with disabilities, who may need\\nassistance or more time to complete tasks.\\n1. By this Unit you can now involve the children in silent reading of the lessons before\\nyou actually start reading aloud to them. Identify a few children who could initiate a\\nreading session for the others. The bottom line for this Unit should be how to involve\\nthe entire class into reading, listening and answering queries.\\n2. A small classwise competition within the school can be initiated.\\n1. Involve the children in sharing what they have felt during warm up time.\\n2. A chart about difficulties that children have in terms of their fears, ,\\ncan be put up in the class.\\nThe idea is not only to make children do things but also to hear and understand what they\\nfeel they can’t do. This feedback will work to sensitise you with their individual needs.\\n1. Emphasise on similar sounding words with different spellings e.g. bee/be, son/sun\\nand other words given in the text.\\n2. Rhyming words can also now be introduced and children can be encouraged to create\\ntheir own little poems using rhyming names in the class (names of children /name of\\nthings in the classrooms) in alphabetical order. These can be put on a chart and\\nchildren can then make a class rhyme.\\n1. The chart above can form the central point of the language corner.\\n2. Children can be subtly involved in making written presentations about their thoughts,\\nfeeling and ideas about this Unit.\\n3.

She climbed a\\nmountain peak of 4000 metres with her friends. The girls had done this for fun and\\nadventure. Soon it was dark and they could not come down. It was also cold and scary.\\nThey were alone without any food and it was a long night. This happened to Bachhendri\\nPal, played when she was a young girl.\\nBachhendri grew up in Nakuri village in the Garhwal area of Uttarakhand. When\\nshe gr ew older , she joined Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, Uttarkashi. Her guide\\nwas Brigadier Gyan Singh. Bachhendri did very well in her training. She started to\\ntrain women in mountaineering courses. In 1984, Bachhendri was selected as a team\\nmember to climb the Mount Everest.\\nSnow storm\\nThere were seven women in that 18 member team. On the night of 15th May the team\\nwas very tired after having reached a height of 7300 metres. The team put up their\\ntents and went to sleep. Around midnight they heard a loud sound and then a bang.\\nBefore they were fully awake, the tent flew off and something very heavy hit them. There\\nwas a terrible snow storm. Bachhendri was almost buried under the snow and was hurt\\non the head. Many of the team members were also injured. The others used snow-picks\\nand axes to dig out those who had been buried under the snow.\\nThe rest of the team members returned to base camp but Bachhendri went ahead,\\nclimbing slowly but steadily towards the peak. It was seven minutes past one o’clock in\\nthe afternoon of 23th May when Bachhendri Pal stepped onto the peak of 8900 metre\\nhigh Mount Everest also called Sagarmatha in Nepal.\\nThere was another team member with her . Ther e was no space for two people to\\nstand on the top at the same time. One slip and they would fall straight down-thousands\\nof feet below! Bachhendri and her team-mate dug into the snow and pitched their axe\\nfirmly in the ice. Using this as a hook, they tied themselves to it with a rope. Only then\\ntwo of them could stand there. She was shivering with cold but filled with the warmth of\\nachievement. She bowed her head, pitched the national flag and took photographs. She\\nspent 43 minutes on the highest peak in the world.\\nBachhendri Pal became the first Indian woman and the fifth woman in the world to\\nreach the peak of Mount Everest.Imagine and Write\\n/rhombus4You ar e on a mountain.

The disease was found in areas where there was a lot of rain, or in swampy\\nplaces. People thought that the illness was caused by some poisonous gas that\\ncame from the dirty swampy areas. They gave it the name 'malaria' which means\\n'bad air'. One doctor had seen tiny germs in the blood of one of the patients, when\\nhe observed it under a microscope. But he could not understand how these had got\\ninto the patient’s blood.\\nMy professor had some ideas about this. “I think that these may be carried by\\nsome kind of mosquito .” As his student, I spent all my time chasing mosquitoes, to\\ncatch and observe . We used to carry empty bottles and chase mosquito after mosquito.\\nThen we would put the mosquitoes into a mosquito net in which there was a patient\\nof malaria. The mosquitoes would have a feast, biting these patients. The patients\\nwere paid one anna  for allowing one mosquitoe  to bite them .\\nI will always remember those days at the hospital in Secundrabad – how we\\nused to cut open the mosquito’s stomach and peep into  it. I would spend hours and\\nhours bent over the microscope. By night my neck would be stiff and my eyes could\\nnot see clearly! It used to be very hot but we dared not fan ourselves, as all the\\nmosquitoes would fly off in the breeze! Once I also fell ill with malaria.\\nI spent months like this with the microscope, but could not find anything. One\\nday we caught a few mosquitoes that looked different. They were brownish with\\nspotted wings. When I looked into the stomach of one of the female mosquitoes, I\\nsaw something black ther e. I looked closer . I saw that these tiny ger ms looked just\\nlike the ones that were found in the blood of malaria patients. At last we had the\\nproof! Mosquitoes did spread malaria!”\\nIn December 1902, Ronald Ross got the highest award for his discovery—the\\nNobel Prize for medicine. In 1905, even as he lay dying, Ross’s last words were, “I\\nwill find something , I will find som ething new.”\\nTeacher’s Note : Tell children that ‘ anna ’ was a form of currency used earlier in\\nIndia. Use the story of Ronald Ross to encourage children to know and talk about\\nscientific processes.

This principle marks a departure from the\\nlegacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between\\nthe school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF\\nsignify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning\\nand the maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these\\nmeasures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of\\neducation outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on what steps that school principals and teachers\\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\\nactivities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given space, time and fr eedom, childr en\\ngenerate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons\\nwhy other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative\\nis possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of\\na fixed body of knowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.\\nFlexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.\\nThe methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of\\nstress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden\\nby restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration\\nfor child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance\\nthis endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and\\nwondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T) appr eciates the\\nhard work done by the textbook development committee r esponsible for this book. W e wish\\nto thank the Chairperson of the Advisory Committee for Textbooks at the the primary level,\\nAnita Rampal, Professor , CIE, Delhi University, Delhi, Chief Advisor , Farah Far ooqi, Reader ,\\nJamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers\\ncontributed to the development of this textbook. W e are grateful to their principals for making\\nthis possible. W e are indebted to the institutions and or\\nganisations which have gener ously\\npermitted us to draw upon their r esour ces, material and personnel. W e are especially grateful\\nto the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of\\nSecondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the\\nChairpersonship of Pr ofessor Mrinal Miri and Pr ofessor G.P .Deshpande, for their valuable\\ntime and contribution.\\nAs an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the\\nquality of its pr oducts, NCER T welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us\\nto undertake further revision and refinement.\\nDirector\\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\\n30 November 2007 Research and Training\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

This subject is not there in Classes I and II, but the issues\\nand concerns related to it are meant to be a part of  Language and Mathematics.\\nThis textbook is child centred, so that children get a lot of space to explore and are not\\ncompelled to lear n by rote. There is no place for definitions and mere  information in this\\nbook. The real challenge is to provide children with opportunities to express, learn by doing,\\nask questions and experiment. The language used  in the book is not formal but that spoken\\nby children. Children see a page of a book as a holistic ‘visual text ’ and not separately as\\nwords and illustrations. Pages have been developed keeping this in mind. The textbook is\\nnot the only source of knowledge,  but sho uld support children to construct knowledge through\\nall sources around them, such as people, their environment, newspapers, etc.\\nThe chapters in this book contain real life incidents, everyday challenges and live\\ncontemporary issues – r elated to petr ol, fuel, water , forests, pr otection of animals, pollution,\\netc. There are ample opportunities for children to freely debate, engage with and develop a\\nsensitive understanding about these. The writing team views not just children but teachers\\ntoo as people who construct knowledge and expand their experiences. Thus teachers also\\nneed to use this book as a teachin g-learning resource.\\nThe new syllabus consists of six themes – (1) Family and Friends, which consists of\\nfour subthemes – (1.1) Relationships, (1.2) W ork and Play, (1.3) Animals and (1.4) Plants.\\nOthers ar e – (2) Food; (3) W ater; (4) Shelter; (5) T ravel and (6) Things W e Make and Do.\\nWhat do we understand by a syllabus? The list of chapters in the textbook is often\\nmistaken to be a syllabus. If we look at the NCER T syllabus, we find that an attempt has\\nbeen made to develop a deep and inter -related understanding of each theme . Each theme\\nbegins with key questions in a language suitable for children. The whole syllabus is available\\non the NCER T websit e www.ncert.nic.in . Also try to get the printed version. On r eading it\\nyou will enjoy teaching the subject with a deeper understanding.\\nTheme 2 – Food\\nThe theme on ‘Food’ integrates all thes e – tastin g, digesting, cooking, preserving techniques,\\nfarmers and hunger .  Chapter 3  does not contain infor mation abo ut the digestive system,\\nbut children ’s experiences have been used to  build  an understanding that the process of\\ndigestion begins in the mouth itself.  This chapter also includes an amazing real story through\\nwhich the world first came to know about the  role of the stomach in digestion.  Later in the\\nchapter , through a description of  the food habits of  two childr en – one who doesn’t get enough\\nfood to eat, and the other who takes  only chips and cold drink s, the chapter tries to raise\\nquestion s about  what \\nis ‘good food’. Also, w hy do  people who grow crops not get enough to eat?A N OTE FOR THE TEACHERS  AND PARENTS\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The story of a bajra  seed ( chapter 19 ) address es\\nsome questions of the syllabus again, like how changes in farming are linked to the changes\\nand difficulties in the lives of  farmers.  Later  you will see how the theme (2) on Food is linked\\nwith the subtheme on Plants (1.4).\\nTheme – Family and Friends\\nSubtheme(1.1) – Relationships\\nChapters 18  and 22 contain experiences of families who migrate in search of work. Children\\nneed help in understanding the difference between ‘transfer’ and ‘displacement’ so that\\nthey become sensitive towar ds pr oblems faced by the urban and rural poor .  Chapter 21\\nfocusses attention on how our identity is shaped by traits we inherit from our family and\\nalso the opportunities we get from our environment.  The purpose of giving Mendel’s story\\n(the son of a poor farmer scared of examinations!) is not to focus on the principles of genetics\\nbut to be inspired by the process of scientific experimentation and his perseverance.\\nSubtheme (1.2) – W ork and Play\\nIn chapter 15 , an inter esting story by Dr .

What do you think about the design of\\nthe building and other arrangements in it?\\nIn Chapter 9 , a teacher’s mountaineering adventure raises the question as to why people\\ntake risks.  It also gives a feel of high, snow covered and difficult mountain terrains, without\\ngiving direct information about facts of geography!  Chapter 10  uses a historical monument\\nto introduce children to the techniques, designs, uses of metals, water arrangements, etc.\\nof earlier times.

The theme ‘Travel’ is\\nnot limited to ‘transport’ but is presented in a wider and more interesting perspective.\\nTheme 6:  Things W e Make and Do\\nThis theme is integrated with all the other themes and emphasises processes and\\ntechinques. Wherever there are experiments in a chapter or things to make and do, children\\nneed to be given opportunities and space to engage with them.\\nWhat will Children Learn in EVS?\\nIn this book ther e is a separate section ‘What we  have  learnt’ at the end of each chapter .\\nThese questions sugges t how children’s learning can be assessed after doing a chapter\\nand also in the examinations.  Answers should not be assessed in terms of only ‘right/\\nwrong’.  Childrens’ ideas, observation reports, expression of their experiences, process of\\nexperiments, etc. are all opportunities for qualitatively assessing children's learning. This\\nlist of indicators for assessment in EVS can be used to record how children are learning.\\nIndicators for Assessment in EVS\\n1.Observation and Recording – Reporting, narrating and drawing; picture-reading, making\\npictures, tables and maps.\\n2.Discussion – Listening, talking, expressing opinions, finding out from other people.\\n3.Expression – Drawing, body movements, creative writing, sculpting, etc.\\n4.Explanation – Reasoning, making logical connections.\\n5.Classification – Categorising, grouping, contrasting and comparing.\\n6.Questioning – Expressing curiosity, critical thinking, developing good questions.\\n7.Analysis – Predicting, making hypotheses and inferences\\n8.Experimentation – Improvisation, making things and doing experiments.\\n9.Concern for Justice and Equality – Sensitivity towards the disadvantaged and differently\\nabled.\\n10. Cooperation – T aking r esponsibility and initiative, sharing and working together .\\nBased on these indicators, teachers can observe 3-5 children everday and record their\\ncomments in order to better understand children’s abilities and to encourage them accordingl y.\\nFor better understanding on assessment practices and pr ocedur\\nes in EVS, NCER T has\\ndeveloped a sourcebook on this area for primary stage.

Bhaskarbhai said they were croton plants which gave him a signal\\nwhen the soil became dry. W e wer e surprised! How? He explained that the\\nroots of the croton do not go deep in the ground.

We thought he must be using some special fertilisers.\\nBhaskarbhai said he does not buy fertilisers made in factories. His soil is\\nfertile because of all the dried leaves which slowly rot and mix with it. He dug\\nthe soil a little and told us to look. W e saw thousands of earthwor ms! “These\\nare my soil's best friends”, he said. The earthworms soften the soil as they\\nkeep digging underneath to make tunnels.

Like everyone else in the Ashram, he had to do various\\nkinds of work. One of his jobs was to teach the guests how to clean the\\ntoilets. In those days, the toilets were not what we know today. There used\\nto be holes under which baskets were kept. People sat on the holes. Later\\nthe baskets had to be lifted by hand, to be emptied.\\nIt was the usual practice that people from a particular community would\\ndo this work. But in Gandhiji’s Ashram, every person had to carry the\\nbasket to the compost pit and empty it there. No one was excused from this\\ntask - not even the guests. Narayanbhai remembers how some people used\\nto try and avoid this work. Some even left the Ashram because of this.\\nSome years later Gandhiji went to stay at a village, near W ardha in\\nMaharashtra. Gandhiji, Mahadevbhai and others started to clean the toilets\\nin the village. They did this for some months. One morning a man coming\\nfrom the toilet, saw Mahadevbhai. He pointed to him and said “There is a\\nlot of dirt over there. Go and clean that!” When Babla saw this, he was very\\nangry. He thought, the villagers felt that this was not their work. This was\\nfor Gandhiji and his team to do. He asked Gandhiji why this was so. Gandhiji\\nreplied, “Untouchability is a serious matter . Lot of har dwork will be r equir ed\\nto change this.”\\nNarayan knew that the people who usually did this work were thought\\nto be untouchable. He asked “What is the use if the village people do not\\nchange their thinking? They have become used to someone else doing this\\nwork for them.”\\nGandhiji replied, “Why”? Don’t you think the people who clean also benefit\\nfrom it. They also learn a lesson. To learn something is like learning a new\\nskill. Even if it is a cleaning job.”\\nLittle Narayan was not convinced.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/pranayyb/Documents/EduIgnite/6_books/2_eng/bemr1ps.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Foreword\\nIndia has a rich tradition of nurturing the holistic development of children \\nduring their most formative years. These traditions provide for complementary roles for the immediate family, the extended family, the community, and \\nformal institutions of care and learning. In addressing the first eight years of a child’s life, this holistic approach — which includes the cultivation of sanskar which are passed on from generation to generation — has a critical and positive lifelong influence on every aspect of a child’s growth, health, behaviour, and cognitive capabilities in the later years. \\nConsidering the importance of the early years in a child’s lifelong \\ndevelopment, the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) envisioned a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure as providing a much needed focus on formal education and childcare in the country during the first five years corresponding to ages 3-8, naming it the Foundational Stage. Classes 1 and 2 form an integral part of this Foundational Stage, continuing from the ages of 3-6 years, in which a child’s holistic growth is taken care of in Balvatika. An individual’s lifelong learning, social and emotional behaviour, and overall health depend deeply upon the experiences gained during this critical Foundational Stage. \\nThe Policy thus recommended developing a National Curriculum \\nFramework specifically for this Stage, which would comprehensively guide the whole education system toward providing high-quality education in children’s early years, thereby carrying this momentum forward to the other later stages of school education. Based on the principles and objectives enunciated under NEP 2020 — as well as on research from a range of disciplines (including neuroscience and early childhood education), on experiences and accumulated knowledge from the ground, and on the aspirations and goals of our Nation — the National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Stage (NCF-FS) was developed and released on 22 October 2022. Subsequently, textbooks have been developed to bring to life the curricular approach of the NCF-FS. The textbooks attempt to connect to the children’s real life by recognising their learning in the classroom and the significant learning resources in the family and the community.\\nThe approach in the NCF-FS is also resonant with the Panchkoshiya Vikas \\n(the development of the five sheaths of human personality) as elucidated in the Taittiriya Upanishad. The NCF-FS enunciates the five domains of learning, i.e., physical and motor; socio-emotional; cognitive; language and literacy; and cultural and aesthetic, which map to the Indian tradition of Panchkosh consisting of five kosh viz. Annamaya, Pranmaya, Manomaya, \\nVijnanmaya and Anandmaya. Besides, it also focuses on integrating a child’s experiences at home with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that would be developed within the school’s precinct. \\nPrelims.indd   3Prelims.indd   3 25-05-2023   11:18:2425-05-2023   11:18:24\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/pranayyb/Documents/EduIgnite/6_books/2_eng/bemr1ps.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='ivThe NCF-FS, which covers Classes 1 and 2, also articulates a play-based \\napproach to learning. According to this approach, books form an essential \\npart of the learning process; however, it is also important to understand that books are only one among many pedagogical tools and methods, including activities, toys, games, conversation, discussion, and more. This marks a departure from the prevailing system of merely learning from books to a more congenial play-way and competency-based learning system, where children’s engagement with what they do and learn becomes critical. Thus, the book in hand must be seen as an instrument to promote a play-based pedagogical approach in its entirety for this age group of children.\\nThe present textbook attempts to provide competency-based content in \\na simple, interesting, and engaging manner. The endeavour has been to make it inclusive and progressive by breaking several stereotypes through the presentation of text and illustrations. The child’s local context, which includes traditions, culture, language usage, and rootedness in India and is central to students’ holistic development, has been reflected in the books. An effort has been made to make it engaging and joyful for the child. The book integrates art and craft to help children appreciate the aesthetic sense inherent in such activities. The textbook provides children with situational awareness to understand the underlying concepts relating to them in their own contexts. Though light in terms of content, this textbook is rich in substance, providing varied experiences and integrating play-way methods of learning through toys, games, and a variety of other activities. It includes questions that will help children develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Besides, the textbook has rich subject matter and activities to help children develop the necessary sensitivity towards our environment. It also provides ample scope for our States/UTs to add/adapt content with local perspectives in the versions that they may develop as per the recommendations of NEP 2020.\\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the committee set up to develop \\nthe syllabus and learning-teaching material for the foundational stage. I thank the Chairperson of this committee, Professor Shashikala Wanjari, and all other members for completing this task in time and in such an admirable way. I am also thankful to all the institutions and organisations which have generously extended their help and assistance in making this possible. I am especially thankful to Dr. K. Kasturirangan, Chairperson of the National Steering Committee, and its other members, including those of the Mandate Group, its Chairperson Professor Manjul Bhargava, and members of the Review Committee, for their timely and valuable suggestions.\\nAs an organisation committed to reforming school education in Bharat \\nand continuously improving the quality of all learning and teaching material that it develops, NCERT looks forward to critical comments and suggestions from all its stakeholders to further improve upon this textbook.\\nProfessor  Dinesh PrasaD  saklani\\nDirector  \\n27 January 2023  National Council of Educational \\nNew Delhi  Research and Training\\nPrelims.indd   4Prelims.indd   4 25-05-2023   11:18:2425-05-2023   11:18:24\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",

As per the National Education Policy 2020, language plays an important role in promoting national development and contributes to the development of a just society. This policy has given much importance to the development of language and literacy in the education of children as these create a foundation for the learning of other subjects. NEP 2020 focusses on developing the skills of learning to learn, problem-solving, logical reasoning, critical thinking and creative thinking along with language development at the Foundational Stage.\\nIn consonance with the approach advocated by the National \\nCurriculum Framework (NCF) 2022 and for Language Education and Literacy at the Foundational Stage, children learn concepts rapidly in their home language. Therefore, the primary medium of instruction would optimally be the child’s home language, mother tongue or familiar language. Hence, here English is considered as second language (L2). Accordingly a communication-focused approach has been adopted in the English textbooks. The aim of this book is to enable the child to develop strong oral language skills (adequate vocabulary and oral expression skills) by the end of Foundational Stage. In addition to oral language development, written language is also being introduced to the learner in a gradual and sequential way. The textbook takes into consideration the curricular goals, competencies and learning outcomes mentioned in the NCF-FS 2022 and the syllabus developed for the Foundational Stage.\\nChildren learn through observation, imitation and collaboration. \\nThey also learn through concrete experiences, using their senses and acting upon the environment; this has been kept in mind while developing the textbook. The content included in this book is drawn from the experiences of children and is suitable for their developmental needs as it provides ample opportunities for imagination, storytelling, art, music and play. The content is also supported with art-integrated and cross-curricular based activities which makes learning fun for the child as well as reflects the life of and around the learner.

Further, the textbooks also encourage the teachers to go beyond the content and use a variety of relevant learning–teaching material depending on the context and the cognitive appropriateness of their learners.\\nIllustrations are of primary importance and more so in a second \\nlanguage textbook, they are not mere add-ons to the textbooks, but are integral to it. Plenty of picture-stories as well as colourful and relevant illustrations support all the texts throughout the book to augment their comprehension. In addition to that, illustrations also provoke the learner’s critical thinking.\\nThe contents selected for learners are meaningful, engaging and \\nprovides scope for further discussion. Sight words are a crucial part of each poem and story to help the children with building their vocabulary. In Class 2, although instructed writing and shared writing constitutes a major part, independent writing has also been introduced.\\nAn effort is made to present language-learning as a holistic process \\nof thinking, listening, observing, speaking, reading, imagining and writing. So, a reading activity may be followed by a drawing task or an oral discussion or could be preceded by a discussion on a picture and so on. A variety of activities, tasks, songs, poems and stories help the learner comprehend and practice the concepts.  These are done through various sections, like ‘Let us Sing’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us Read’, ‘Let us Draw’, ‘Let us Say’ and ‘Let us  Write’. This not only helps the learner in the process of language acquisition but also builds up their confidence level.\\nThe curricular goals (CG-as mentioned in NCF-FS) have been \\naddressed in the textbook. CG 9.1 ‘listens to and appreciates simple songs, rhymes and poems’ finds ample reflection in the action songs and engaging short poems given at the beginning of every chapter. Young learners are encouraged  to think of rhyming words, which addresses CG 9.2. Words related to familiar objects and events from day-to-day life are found in all the lessons in this textbook. This is related to CG 9.7— ‘knows and uses enough words to carry out day-to-day interactions effectively and can guess the meaning of new words by using existing vocabulary’. Further, there are exercises provided for young learners to engage in meaningful conversation, which is very important in L2.  \\nCG 9.3 rightly addresses  ‘converses fluently and can hold a meaningful conversation’.\\nOne of the highlights of the book is the focus on communication in \\neach lesson/chapter/theme in the subsection titled ‘Let us speak’. The objective of the activities is to encourage conversation and develop the child’s confidence in speaking in English, so that the child will move progressively towards independent engagement with English language.\\nActivities such as ‘Colour the hut’ are examples of a series  of \\ninstructions that the child needs to understand to complete a given task, as indicated in CG 9.4. Interesting stories in simple language \\nPrelims.indd   6Prelims.indd   6 23-05-2023   15:21:4223-05-2023   15:21:42\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",

A lot of exercises related to phonological awareness have been introduced at regular intervals throughout the book, to address CG 11.1. Phonological awareness is the ability to discriminate between similar sounding words. Since a child who is phonologically aware is more likely to become a successful reader, it was important to find ways of developing this awareness through tasks given in the textbook. Most importantly, children are encouraged to have fun and play with words. \\nOne of the major recommendations of NCF-FS 2022 is the inclusion \\nof knowledge of India. Indian values and traditions have been presented to the learner in an easily comprehensible and acceptable way. This has been achieved through aptly placed illustrations with Indian local games and Indianised form of Cricket i.e. bat-ball in ‘Out! Out!’, and with the simple yet meaningful portrayal of regional diversity in ‘We  are all Indians’. ‘Little Drops of Water’, a short yet an important poem is reflective of the Indian value of cooperation and peaceful co-existence.\\nIn Unit 1 titled ‘Fun With Friends’, children get a glimpse of having \\nfun by oneself in ‘My Bicycle’ and the joy of playing a variety of games like Bat-ball, gilli-danda with friends during holidays \\nIn Unit 2 titled ‘Welcome to My World’ young learners are exposed \\nto a variety of verbs through the actions they do in ‘It’s Fun’ whereas ‘Seeing without Seeing’ sensitises them towards differently abled people. It also introduces the idea of belonging to home and beyond in ‘This is My Town’.\\nUnit 3 titled ‘Going Places’ focuses on the concept of travel and modes \\nof transport\\n — the journey of reaching school from the perspective of a \\nyoung learner. \\n Unit 4 ‘Life \\nAround Us’ brings forth the skill of observation, \\nimagination and perception in the poem ‘A Show of Clouds’. It also includes a story of a fly that has forgotten its name. \\nThe poem “The Crow” brings out the concepts of self-esteem and \\nthe idea of self in a subtle way. Hygiene and cleanliness is the central idea of the story “The Smart Monkey” which brings into discussion the necessity of taking care of oneself and of the surroundings. Chapter 8 focuses on regional and National identity, patriotism and togetherness. The chapter aligns with the Indian ethos of ‘Unity in Diversity’. The chapter ends with a short play on ‘Charkha’ and its association with Mahatma Gandhi.\\nMultilingualism has been interwoven into the tasks and activities \\nwith specific guidelines to the teacher, wherever required. This facilitates the learner to move progressively from the home language to English. It also helps to shift from teacher-driven classroom to learner-centric classroom. \\nPrelims.indd   7Prelims.indd   7 23-05-2023   15:21:4223-05-2023   15:21:42\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",

It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos \\nand constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage. \\nThe Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the \\nFoundational and the Middle Stages, spanning three years from Grade 3 to Grade 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way, discovery, and activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and more formal classroom settings. This introduction aims not to overwhelm but to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social science. This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage. \\nThe textbook, Santoor for Grade 3 is meticulously \\ndesigned to align with these objectives. It adheres to the recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023. The textbook emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, values and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness integrating appropriate ICT and school-based assessments.

The present textbook is designed in alignment with the visionary framework of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) for School Education 2023. In the preparatory stage, students develop proficiency in speaking and competencies in reading and writing in both languages — Reading in Language 1 (R1) and Reading in Language 2 (R2). While students achieve these faster in R1, they are expected to gain familiarity with R2, gradually progressing from basic communication skills to greater fluency and proficiency in speaking and writing.\\nTo take children well beyond foundational literacy and \\ndevelop a genuine interest in independent reading, the textbook draws from children’s real-life experiences and reflects their cultural and social milieu. It is purposefully crafted to meet specific stage competencies and grade-based learning outcomes, ensuring alignment with core principles of the subject. It uses language appropriate for the grade level and provides support for unfamiliar vocabulary and complex sentence structures. It incorporates digital elements and external references suitably within the material. Local context heavily influences content selection. The textbook aims to be engaging, striking a balance between visuals and text, leaning towards visually appealing material making it suitable for easy comprehension by young learners.\\nTo foster oral skills, this textbook offers engaging learning \\nmaterials that encourage students to converse with each other. The content features a range of activities such as reciting rhymes, singing songs, role-playing, etc., facilitating in-class practice. To enhance reading abilities, the textbook presents a diverse array of content, encompassing stories, poems, narratives and a comic strip.

The content is \\nstructured to aid students in transitioning from guided to independent reading. For honing writing skills, the selected content systematically imparts writing proficiency. Students engage in activities that encourage independent practice, such as constructing simple sentences, encouraging creative expression and skill development in writing.\\nAll these are done through various sections, like ‘Let us \\nrecite’, ‘Let us think’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us learn’, ‘Let us listen’, and ‘Let us write’, ‘Let us do’, and ‘Let us explore’. This not only helps the learner in the process of language acquisition but also builds up their confidence level.\\nCurricular Goals (CG) lay the foundation of every \\nlearning-teaching material. In line with the textbooks for Classes 1 and 2, Santoor (Class 3) has been developed after careful consideration of the curricular goals. The curricular goals for language address the diverse needs of learners in a language classroom. Communication and comprehension are at the heart of every language and the same has been reiterated through CG1: Sustains effective communication skills for day-to-day interactions, enhancing their oral ability to express ideas. The book provides ample opportunities for learners to engage with the text and share their input. Sections titled ‘Let us speak’ and ‘Think and say’ subsection of ‘Let us think’ present opportunities for students to be creative with replies and share with classmates allowing learners to engage with language in a meaningful way.\\nSimilarly, CG 4: Develops a wide range of vocabulary in \\nvarious contexts and through different sources has been addressed by incorporation of texts and activities that are not limited only to literature but also encompass content areas like mathematics and ‘The World Around Us’ activities and vocabulary pertaining to the same find a place in different units. For example, Unit 1 has activities related to shapes whereas, Unit 4 provides scope for learners and teachers to discuss ordinal numbers.\\nIn Class 3, although guided writing is the main component, \\nthere is a gradual progress towards making learners independent writers.
